My first python project, generating an audio/visual interpretation of results from Morrow &amp; Mittelstaedt, 2021:  https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB021726

Includes data from https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB021726 in peaks files

Outputs midi files and a video - midi files can be loaded into a DAW (I use REAPER: https://www.reaper.fm/) to generate noises (music) from the midi outputs. Each hotspot has its own track.
